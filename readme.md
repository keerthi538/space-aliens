# 🚀 Alien Blaster 3000 🌌

In the not-so-distant future (or maybe Tuesday), aliens have come to Earth… but they didn’t bring snacks. 👽💥

**Your Mission**: Dodge lasers, blast aliens, and save humanity—all with the power of your spacebar! This is your time to shine, hero. Don’t let Earth down!

## How to Play 🕹️

1. **Load the Game**: Open `index.html` in your browser. (Real gamers know, right?)
2. **Defend Earth**: Use the arrow keys to move and the spacebar to fire. Aim for those pesky space invaders.
3. **Pro Tips**: Dodge everything that moves... and everything that doesn’t.

## Features 🌠

- **Old-School Vibes**: Feel the pixelated nostalgia of games past!
- **One Hero, One Button**: Because complex controls are overrated.
- **Unlimited Aliens**: Because why not?

Now get out there, space cadet, and blast some aliens! (Or… try not to get blasted yourself.) 🌌
